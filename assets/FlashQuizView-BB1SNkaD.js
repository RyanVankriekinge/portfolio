Additionally, I explored existing lobby systems and determined which user interfaces work best for this type of application. Based on this research, I created a mood board and designed a simple, user-friendly interface in Adobe XD.</p><img src="'+m+'" data-v-5d0a2975><h3 class="image-title" data-v-5d0a2975>Design</h3><p data-v-5d0a2975>I chose to create a mobile design that easily extends to desktop because quiz apps are typically used on-the-go, making mobile the most convenient option. A mobile-first approach is also recommended for web development as it prioritizes performance and user experience and it&#39;s easy to scale up to a desktop design.</p><img src="'+v+'" data-v-5d0a2975></div><div class="section" data-v-5d0a2975><div class="column" data-v-5d0a2975><h2 class="prototype-title title typing-animation" data-v-5d0a2975>Process: Development</h2><h3 data-v-5d0a2975>Classes</h3><p data-v-5d0a2975>I created a class diagram (UML) in draw.io and made sure to include all the important classes that are needed to allow users to create an account, quizzes with questions and lobbies. </p><h3 data-v-5d0a2975>Storing my data with MongoDB</h3><p data-v-5d0a2975>I opted for a Node.js back-end combined with a MongoDB database. I chose MongoDB because it handles different quiz formats better than relational databases, which need rigid schemas. For example, you can easily store different types of questions in the same collection, with each type having its own structure. It manages complex data like questions and answers efficiently, scales well for high traffic, and speeds up development with its simple document-based structure.</p><h3 data-v-5d0a2975>WebSockets with socket.io</h3><p data-v-5d0a2975> I chose to use Socket.IO for this project because it seems the most suitable. It’s beginner-friendly, automatically handles reconnecting and fallbacks, and integrates smoothly with Node.js. The event-driven model works well with Vue, making it easy to update the front-end in real-time. It works well with MongoDB, enabling instant data synchronization across clients. Socket.IO also reduces setup complexity, allowing me to focus on building features rather than managing real-time communication.</p></div><div class="column" data-v-5d0a2975><img src="'+g+'" data-v-5d0a2975></div></div><div class="section" data-v-5d0a2975><h2 class="prototype-title title typing-animation" data-v-5d0a2975>Reflection and next steps</h2><h3 data-v-5d0a2975>Challenges and solutions</h3><ol data-v-5d0a2975><li data-v-5d0a2975>Underestimated scope: I made this project during a sprint of only 2 weeks, so my goals were quite ambitious.

This happened because I passed these variables as props from the page where the lobby was joined. The solution was to retrieve this data directly on the lobby page and update it via emits. </li><li data-v-5d0a2975>Real-Time Updates for host: Occasionally, the host account would not receive certain emits, such as a player joining or the quiz starting. I partially resolved this by tweaking the emits, but the issue still occasionally occurs.
