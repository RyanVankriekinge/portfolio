The curricula have so far contained few real programming subjects and computer science lessons are increasingly being removed from the teaching programs by schools. In this way there will continue to be a shortage of people who learn this valuable skill. </p><br data-v-b1a65260><p data-v-b1a65260>I think it is important that students are prepared for the future, in which technology will most likely have a big role. Therefore, learning this skill would make children future proof and would also teach them valuable skills like computational thinking, problem solving and logic. That&#39;s why I asked myself the question: How can I explain the concept and benefits of programming in a way that&#39;s suitable for children. </p><h3 data-v-b1a65260>Assignment</h3><p data-v-b1a65260>Because children generally have a short attention span and like to be stimulated visually, I took the opportunity to work on this problem for my Motion graphics course, because for this course, our main assignment was to make a short animation video. </p><h3 data-v-b1a65260>Choosing an animation style</h3><div class="column" data-v-b1a65260><p data-v-b1a65260>I started my process by choosing an animation style that fits the message of my video. Because my main audience consists of children, I wanted to make something that speaks to them. After doing some research around possible styles, I decided to go with papercut animation. The bright colours and crafty aspect make it an appropriate style for a young audience. </p><br data-v-b1a65260><p data-v-b1a65260>When I was younger, I loved making stop motion videos, so I tried to mimic this style by using certain techniques in after effects that make animation videos appear like mixed media videos. The most important things I did, were: using paper textures for all the shapes, using hold keyframes, moving the shapes by a small randomised amount at every keyframe and creating depth by using highlights and shadows. </p></div><div class="column" data-v-b1a65260><img src="'+v+'" data-v-b1a65260></div></div><div class="section" data-v-b1a65260><div class="column prototype-bottom" data-v-b1a65260><img src="'+g+'" style="max-height:100vh;" data-v-b1a65260></div><div class="column prototype-top" data-v-b1a65260><h2 class="title prototype-title typing-animation" data-v-b1a65260>Animating</h2><p data-v-b1a65260>After choosing an animation style, I started by writing the script for the video. When the script was done, I made a story board to visualise the outline of the video. To make my video appear as realistic as possible, I created one scene with actual paper cuts and analysed the typical aspects of a paper cut animation so I could recreate the look digitally. I created all my characters and props with Adobe Illustrator and rigged and animated them using After Effects and Duik Angela. </p><p data-v-b1a65260>After completing the animation, I added sound effects and a voice over as well as some background music. This made the video really come to life.
